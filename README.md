deep_learning_assignment
This project demonstrates deep learning fundamentals using PyTorch. It explores autograd for automatic gradient computation, implements a fully connected neural network for MNIST digit classification, and designs a convolutional neural network for CIFAR-10 image recognition.

Deep Learning Assignment: Autograd, FCNN (MNIST), CNN (CIFAR-10)
📖 Project Description
This project explores fundamental deep learning concepts using PyTorch:

Automatic Gradient Computation (Autograd): Demonstrates how PyTorch tracks operations and computes gradients automatically.
Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN): Implements a simple neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Builds and trains a CNN for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The project is structured into three scripts:

autograd_exploration.py → Autograd demo
fcnn_mnist.py → FCNN for MNIST digit classification
cnn_cifar10.py → CNN for CIFAR-10 image classification
All code is written in Python and managed with GitHub for version control.
